# Question 03 - PGCC Application

## Describe in detail the extent and relevance of your teaching experience to anticipated teaching assignments.


Teaching assignments clearly can vary, but here I will highlight some common threads from my past experience which could easily apply or be adapted for future duties as an Instructor at Prince George's Community College. In particular, I draw from the formative experience while employed at the Academic Center of Social Sciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (CACS-UFMG), where had a range of responsibilities including classroom instruction, administration, and curriculum development. Here below I will briefly touch upon how I see these skills transferring to meet the challenges of teaching busy adult learners seeking to extend their path in higher learning.

In the area of classroom instruction, my tasks at CACS-UFMG mainly involved developing syllabi and planning lessons, grading written and oral examinations, but also included detailed administrative tasks such as promoting classes, advising new students, and routine administrative tasks. These latter duties I feel transfer to all institutions of higher learning. As for teaching materials, although the native tongue of my students was Brazilian Portuguese, the lesson plans and syllabi I developed pull from a core base of knowledge which can easily be adapted to second language learners from any background. 

Not only do administrative tasks and professional touchstones like curriculum development transfer well, but as a professional at CACS-UFMG I cultivated active participation in the wider institutional academic life. This included such events as regular workshops and helping organize bi-semester events like “Cultural Fair” and “Noche Española” (“Spanish Night”), a student gathering hosted at a local Spanish restaurant and focused on practicing Spanish. Guests were invited to play games, to sing karaoke, and to eat--all in Spanish!

Clearly the basis for meeting the challenges of anticipated teaching assignments comes from my extensive academic training. But in addition to this, teaching experience can be relevantly applied to activities in the classroom, administrative duties as a faculty member, and wider participation in academic life. While there is no shortcut for the hard work that goes into adapting these materials and experiences, I do note that they examplify how being a well-prepared and adaptable professional can be a positive influence on future students looking to put their best foot forward.
