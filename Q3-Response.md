While employed at the Academic Center of Social Sciences, [where?], I had diverse responsibilities. These included classroom instruction, student administration, and curriculum development. Although other teaching experiences required similar responsibilities, I will describe this one in particular as it encompassed a wide diversity of duties. In the area of classroom instruction, my tasks involved developing syllabi, planning lessons, grading and commenting on oral and writing tests, creating evaluated written compositions, and choosing a literature book to be assigned in class, to mention a few. Regarding student administration, I had to submit students’ grades and absences at the management system, answer emails from students and coordination, join teachers’ meetings, and recruit new professionals. As a professional at the Center, I should also attend their regular workshops and help in the organization of two events per semester, the “Cultural Fair” and the “Noche Española” (“Spanish Night”, a students’ gathering at a local Spanish restaurant where the guests were invited to play games, to sing karaoke, and to eat, all in Spanish).
