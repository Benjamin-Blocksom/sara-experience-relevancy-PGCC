# Question 03 - PGCC Application

## Describe in detail the extent and relevance of your teaching experience to anticipated teaching assignments.

As in every teaching practice, when I am asked to elaborate a course program, I build it according to the students’ needs. Most of the times, previous program courses can be readapted to a different group of students with just a few adjustments. However, special circumstances can make this adaptation a hinder for the learning process. In order to show the extent and relevance of my teaching experience, I am going to describe two situations that encouraged me to teach the whole course without resorting to previous work. 

As a teacher, I have noticed that the organization of the contents in SSL (Spanish as a Second Language) textbooks is mostly determined by lexical fields. For example, there is usually a chapter for the names of the “rooms of the house”. For students who live in an urban environment, this content does not clash with their archetype of a house. However, there are students who sleep, eat, and rest in huts with no inside division. This is the reality of a group of indigenous who were once interested in learning Spanish and had myself as their teacher. This challenging experience encouraged me to develop a course program of Spanish that combined social and anthropological issues. First, I focused on awaking awareness of the students’ way of life. After, these issues could be directed to the reality of the Hispanic world. 

Another experience that is worth mentioning is as the Spanish teacher for Spanish teachers of High Schools. These particular students were experienced professionals who lacked theoretical and methodological updates. When I was faced with the challenge of teaching for teachers, I noticed a completely absence of textbooks written for this specific public. In face of this problem, I decided to create my own SSL Textbook. The result of this production 
 combined linguistic issues in advanced Spanish with a pedagogical orientation,
 
 , combinação esta que enquadrava perfeitamente à realidade dos alunos. 
 Esses dois relatos breves dão um panorama da extensão e relevância da minha experiência docente. Reconheço que o meu papel como professora muitas vezes assemelha-se a criar emaranhados com os recursos disponíveis de forma a estabelecer pontes entre duas realidades, a do aluno e a do universo hispânico. Esta constante criação se aplica tanto a alunos em situações especiais, como é o caso dos indígenas e dos professores de espanhol, como à ampla diversidade de culturas e etnias presentes no ambiente do campus universitário.
