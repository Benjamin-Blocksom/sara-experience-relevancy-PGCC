# Question 03 - PGCC Application

## Describe in detail the extent and relevance of your teaching experience to anticipated teaching assignments.

As in every teaching practice, when I am asked to elaborate a course program, I build it according to the students’ needs. Most of the times, previous program courses can be readapted to a different group of students with just a few adjustments. However, special circumstances can make this adaptation a hinder for the learning process. In order to show the extent and relevance of my teaching experience, I am going to describe two situations that encouraged me to teach the whole course without resorting to previous work.
